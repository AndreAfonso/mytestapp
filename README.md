# mytestapp

Hello welcome to my test app,

This app was created with the purpose of a technical assignment to show my skills and abilities on Front End development using React for the company Bliss Applications.

It's a very simple app with a loading screen where if the connection is stable redirects you to new page where you can see a List of questions and select a question of that list. On selecting a question it opens a new page showing more details of that question and the answers available for voting. 

More features of this app:
Fetch more questions if desired.
Search on list.
Internet connectivity status
Page not found.
Share screen

To starting using the app it is required to do the next two scripts:

In the project directory, you need to run:

### `npm install` -> Where it installs the required node modules for the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Optional commands:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
